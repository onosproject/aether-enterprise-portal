## Developer Information

### Implementation

When the **Device/SIM Component** is loaded:

- A function is called to set the current Site.
- A REST-API request is sent as a GET to [https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/chronos-exporter/config](https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/chronos-exporter/config).
- This request returns the info of the devices and SIMs available for the site.
- Multiple REST-API requests are sent as GET to [https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/prometheus/api/v1/query_range?query=device_connected_status{site=%22fremont%22,%20iccid=%22123-456-784%22}&start=2022-03-02T23:31:48.000Z&end=2022-03-03T23:31:48.000Z&step=60m](https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/prometheus/api/v1/query_range?query=device_connected_status{site=%22fremont%22,%20iccid=%22123-456-784%22}&start=2022-03-02T23:31:48.000Z&end=2022-03-03T23:31:48.000Z&step=60m) where device details are requested.
- This data is used and displayed the chart using D3 time line chart.
- User can hover over the events to look at the message related to the event.
- As the API is only available for fetching the devie groups.
- The fetched device groups are stored into the array.
- All the CRUD operations that are performed after the initial fetch are handled in the frontend.
- Using Array methods like push, splice etc these CRUD operations are performed.
- All the sections data are handled using services available in the application.
