## Developer Information

### Implementation

When the **Device Groups Component** is loaded:

- A function is called to set the current Site.
- A REST-API request is sent as a GET to [https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/chronos-exporter/config](https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/chronos-exporter/config).
- This request returns the info of the device groups available for the site.
- Mat Step is used for the steps in add device group scren.
- As the API is only available for fetching the devie groups.
- The fetched device groups are stored into the array.
- All the CRUD operations that are performed after the initial fetch are handled in the frontend.
- Using Array methods like push, splice etc these CRUD operations are performed.
