- In edit user screen user has an option to view the audit of the user and also to delete the user. Both of the actions will trigger and open dialogs.
- These dialogs can be viewed in the [`Dialog Components`](../dialogs/README.md).

- Admin also has the option to view the users based on the sites using the `filter by site` that is located in the top right of the screen.

## Developer Information

### Implementation

When the **Admin Component** is loaded:

- API is not avialable to fetch the users.
- So it is designed in such a way that a list of users is created in the Users service.
- In this list the users access permissions are also being handled.
- Every user and site edit is handled directly in the service.
- Which maintains accurate data displaying the correct users and sites.
