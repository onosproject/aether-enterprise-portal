## Developer Information

### Implementation

When the **Services Component** is loaded:

- A function is called to set the current Site.
- A REST-API request is sent as a GET to [https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/chronos-exporter/config](https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/chronos-exporter/config).
- This request returns the info of the services(applications) available for the site.
- Mat Select is used for the dropdowns in the edit and add services view.
- As the API is only available for fetching the services.
- The fetched services are added into the array.
- All the CRUD operations that are performed after the initial fetch are handled in the frontend.
- Using Array methods like push, splice etc these CRUD operations are performed.
