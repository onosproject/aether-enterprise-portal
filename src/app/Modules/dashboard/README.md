- `Dashboard` contains lot of sections where users can find minimal required information.
- The top section of the dashboard contains the list of sites with images and some basic information of that particular site.
- Users can switch between sites by clicking on the respective cards and in the bottom the site related information is displayed.
- Immediately after the sites, the bandwidth information of the site is displayed.
- `Highlights` of that particular site are also visible next to the bandwidth information.
- Below the bandwidth the `slices` in the selected site are displayed in the list view.
- Each `Slice` can be expanded using the plus icon to display the detailed view of the slice.

## Developer Information

### Implementation

When the **Dashboard** is loaded:

- A function is called to set the current Site.
- A REST-API request is sent as a GET to [https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/chronos-exporter/config](https://chronos-dev.onlab.us/chronos-exporter/config).
- Dashboard is created as an Angular Module.
- All the visual information available in the dashboard are broken into multiple Angular components and are avilable in the pages folder.
- Using **@Input, @Output** and **@ViewChild** parameters from Angular Core are used to pass the information from Dashboard Component to the pages components.
- **parentWillTakeAction** function declared in the Dashboard component is responsible for handling the click functionalities.
- The Slices in the slices component can be drag and drop which will help the user to assign them as per their requirement.
- [Joiner Module](../joiner/README.md) is used in the Small Cells and Slices for connecting the HTML elements with svg lines.
